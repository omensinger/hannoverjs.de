            <h3>Robin Thrift - <span class="speaker__talk-name">React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</span></h3>
            <p>
                React is the V in MVC, but it's more than just a fancy new templating language. This talk aims to demystify React.js,
                what it is, and why you should use it.

            <h3>Pascal Precht - <span class="speaker__talk-name">Dependency Injection in Angular 2</span></h3>
            <p>
Because we think dependency injection is cool and that it makes life of all us developers a looot easier, we want to start off our talk by first understanding what dependency injection stands for and why it is such a blessing in disguise...and also because first things first
Once that is clear we can dive deeper into some existing implementations, to get a real feel of how it all works, and finish by looking at how these implementations are used inside the new Angular 2, by embracing the power of TypeScript annotations.
